# Doubly Linked List
A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.
Therefore, in a doubly linked list, a node consists of three parts: node data, pointer to the next node in sequence (next pointer) .
This document contains the implementation of doubly linked list.i.e. adding a node,traversing forward and reverse through the list and adding a headnode.
